### Set Up

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**
    To avoid dependency conflicts, create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it (Windows)
    venv\Scripts\activate  

    # Activate it (Mac/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate  
    ```
    In our project we use python 3.10 due to its stability. 

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Before running the project, install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
